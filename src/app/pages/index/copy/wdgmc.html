<p>The Wits Donald Gordon Medical Centre (WDGMC) is the first and only private teaching hospital in Africa.</p>

<p>It was established in 2002 when the Donald Gordon Foundation bought the Kenridge Hospital for the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) and we set about renovating, rebuilding, and equipping it with state-of-the-art equipment and facilities. The institution was then renamed the Wits Donald Gordon Medical Centre.</p>

<p>In 2005, Mediclinic Private Hospital Group became a partner with Wits University and was also awarded the management contract.</p>

<p>The hospital was established to create a facility in the private sector to train and retain specialists and sub-specialists in South Africa for South Africa. All training programmes are fully integrated and complementary to the existing training programmes within the Wits Faculty of Health Sciences.</p>

<p>Having successfully encouraged private practitioners to join its mission, the hospital’s occupancy slowly developed to a 50% level and in 2009 finally began making a profit. The hospital now runs at maximum capacity and has established itself as a referral centre for complex surgery in the fields of Hepatobiliary Surgery, Colorectal Surgery ,Oncology Vascular Surgery in particular. </p>

<p>The first private Liver Transplant Unit was established in 2004, and the centre now hosts the largest Solid Organ Transplant Programme in the country. We are delighted to be opening a newly built Transplant Wing which houses a Dedicated Paediatric Liver Transplant ward as well as a dedicated Transplant ICU. This unit will open in March 2019.</p>

<p>Training of specialist practitioners started for the first time in 2007 when the first trainees were appointed. Since then it has grown from three registrars and one fellow to seventeen fellowships and six registrars. A total of 78 Specialists and Sub-specialists have been trained in the last 11 years with 4 times that number receiving a period of training at the facility as part of the rotational training with the other sites in the Wits Health Sciences Faculty Training Platform. </p>

<p>All profits generated at the facility are used to fund the training of specialists and sub-specialists. This is augmented by the support of donors, without whom the programme would not have grown to the level that it has.</p>

<p>In 2014, we established the WDGMC Research Unit, the first of its kind in the Private Health care sector in South Africa. The unit has been successful in mentoring private practitioners to carry out clinical research with the view to improving patient care. </p>

<p>The Centre has recruited and trained a group of dedicated practitioners who are committed to ensuring the future of health care and training in South Africa, which sets it apart from other private hospitals in the country.</p>

<p>The Centre provides training in disciplines that are currently not available to the same extent, if at all, anywhere else in South Africa, and enables the retention of highly skilled doctors within the country.</p>

<td valign="top" ><p><b>The Donald Gordon Foundation Division of Geriatric Medicine</b> </p>

<p>The Division of Geriatric Medicine is jointly based at the Wits Donald Gordon Medical Centre and the Helen Joseph Hospital. The unit was established in March 2007 and is currently the largest Sub-specialist Geriatric Medicine Unit (from both a training and service delivery perspective) in Sub-Saharan Africa. The unit is unique in that to date all funding for the training posts of the unit have been from the Donald Gordon Foundation via the Wits Donald Gordon Medical Centre. The unit is also unique in that it is entirely run by fulltime private practitioners affiliated with the University of the Witwatersrand via the Wits Donald Gordon Medical Centre. The unit is accredited with the Health Professions Council since 2008. Since June 2011 there has been a rotating medical registrar, and since January 2012 sub-speciality fellowship trainees. Since 2014 the training platform has been expanded to also facilitate the diploma of Geriatric Medicine for general practitioners.</p>

<p>(The Wits Geriatric Medicine unit has thus to date trained 35% of currently registered Sub-specialist Geriatricians in Sub-Saharan Africa)</p>

<p>The Wits and Kwa-Zulu Natal Geriatric Medicine Units spearheaded the development of a Diploma in Geriatric Medicine to be examined via the South African Geriatrics Society by the Colleges of Medicine in South Africa (CMSA) but run at local HPCSA accredited University Geriatric Medicine Divisions. This Diploma was finally approved and commenced in April 2014. The Wits Division of Geriatric Medicine is providing the necessary training support to practitioners who will be undertaking the Diploma in Geriatric Medicine. The curriculum for the Diploma is as per the Colleges of Medicine of South Africa which is available on their website.</p>

<p>We continue with a program to meet the requirements of further general practitioners.</p>

<p>Our division again actively contributed to the annual South African Geriatrics Society meeting 24th till 26th August held in Durban. The meeting attracted 164 participants with 112 being general practitioners. </p>
