<p>SECTION27 is a well-established public interest law centre that seeks to achieve substantive equality and social justice in South Africa. Guided by the principles and values in the Constitution, SECTION27 uses law, advocacy, legal literacy, research and community mobilisation to improve access to healthcare services and quality basic education. SECTION27 works tirelessly to alleviate short term crises such as textbook shortages and infrastructure crises in the health and education. But their overall aim is to achieve structural change and accountability to ensure the dignity and equality of everyone. </p>
<p>Underpinning all of their work is the promotion of the rights to equality and dignity as well as the principles of good governance and accountability. Across their areas of work we are concerned with ensuring that both public and private power is exercised responsibly, accountably and in the interest of justice. </p>
<p>Their mission is to expand access to justice for marginalised and vulnerable citizens in the interests of equality and to ensure they are empowered to realise their constitutional rights.</p>
<p><b>Protecting independent public institutions and demanding good governance:</b></p>

<p>Over the last few years SECTION27 has been involved in a number of initiatives to challenge corruption and hold the executive to the principles of the Constitution.</p>
<p>SECTION27 is currently a partner in an initiative to Save South Africa which calls on all South Africans to come together in a campaign to highlight our common values and demand open, accountable and responsive government. </p>
<p>Save South Africa demands principled, ethical leadership. It calls for:</p>

<p>President Zuma to step down from office.</p>

<p>The election of a new President who respects the Constitution and upholds its values.</p>

<p>An end to the abuse of executive power.</p>

<p>A national dialogue on the restoration of democratic values and beliefs.</p>

<p>A renewed climate of civic engagement. </p> <p>SECTION27 has a national footprint, specifically through their work in education and health. They have established firm partnerships with community organisations and coalitions. They have an ability and track record of intervening in the big questions which have been posed far too frequently. They have managed to establish themselves as a legitimate voice in the eyes of ordinary people as well as with leaders across the spectrum of society. They are passionate about education and health and their daily work has been a conduit into trying to address the political challenges we currently face. This has also placed them close to the networks of power and gives them opportunities to truly play a role towards a better life for all. If we are appropriately funded they can have a meaningful impact on improving our education system and in turn play an even more central role towards a better future for our country. </p>
