<p>Freedom of opinion and a free press are vital enduring values – so much so that they are enshrined in the South African Constitution. Their protection is essential and cannot be left to others or taken for granted. Without a free media South Africa would be on a trajectory to despotism. The media is called ‘The Fourth Estate’ because it is so essential a pillar of society, a critical check and balance to counter untruths and corruption. Daily Maverick is the only truly (literally!) free voice left in South Africa’s media. </p>



<p>Daily Maverick has no political agenda and is aligned to no ideological standpoint other than its commitment to report the truth without fear or favour.</p>



<p>Highly unusual in the media is their absolute transparency. In this era of ‘fake news’ the Daily Maverick is rare: nothing is opaque or unavailable. Their ownership structure is open to scrutiny, all bylines transparent, all journalists identified.</p>



<p>The Daily Maverick has, over the years, has worked on several large exposés that have affected the very trajectory of South Africa’s society. From exposing police brutality in the Marikana massacre, through the lies behind the SARS “Rogue Unit” reporting, and more recently the GuptaLeaks, Daily Maverick has been a potent force informing the debate in South Africa.</p>



<p>Through exposing the inner mechanism of State Capture and documenting corruption at the highest levels of government and state-owned enterprises, Daily Maverick has played a central role in the events which ultimately led to the resignation of President Jacob Zuma. It is clear that without the Daily Maverick Jacob Zuma would still be President of South Africa, and Mrs Dlamini Zuma the President of the ANC and his successor in the Union Buildings. State capture would have been completed and the Guptas ensconced in Saxonwold. The Treasury would have been pillaged, and Eskom, Transnet, SAA, Denel – all of the State Owned Enterprises would have been closer to collapse than they are.</p>

<p>Daily Maverick has done the investigations and research where the Hawks have failed, and the Daily Maverick has provided the evidence necessary for the Directorate of Public Prosecutions, Parliamentary Committees and the Courts.</p>



<p>By way of a few examples:</p>

<p>August 2012: Daily Maverick investigated and exposed the murder of striking miners that the SAPS attempted to cover up as self-defence. A Commission of Enquiry was established.</p>



<p>October 2016: Daily Maverick bust the SARS ‘Rogue Unit’ narrative and proved that KPMG were complicit in a dirty tricks campaign to discredit Minister of Finance Pravin Gordhan. Moreover, Daily Maverick proved that the Sunday Times reporting was compromised (they later apologized to the Minister).</p>



<p>June 2017: Daily Maverick investigated and highlighted the GuptaLeaks. Daily Maverick uncovered 71 exposes into State Capture proving the extent to which the Gupta brothers controlled South African politics. Many public and private sector officials resigned and Cyril Ramaphosa rode an anti-corruption ticket to claim the ANC’s, and country’s, presidency by a tiny margin.</p>



<p>March 2018: Zuma’s appointee as SARS Commissioner, Tom Moyane, was suspended by President Ramaphosa following a series of DM investigations exposing his role in the cover-up of the Makwakwa affair and other illicit dealings whilst head of SARS. This followed Makwakwa’s initial suspension based on DM’s work.</p>



<p>Late in 2018, Scorpio uncovered the fraudulent dealings of Julius Malema, Floyd Shivambu and the EFF itself as they joined the local corrupt government officials and other opportunists in a feeding frenzy over the VBS Bank carcass.</p>



<p>This comes at a price. DM is not financially viable and needs constant funding. The Daily Maverick is available for free. This obviously makes it broadly accessible, but costly in that a major potential revenue stream is lost. Whilst they have some advertising revenue, they are heavily dependent on donations.</p>



<p>Investigative journalism is very expensive. Whistleblowers are marginalised after coming forward, often with serious financial implications to go along with the usual physical security threats. Daily Maverick also tries to raise funding for their safety and legal aid, which can include relocation out of the country. The GuptaLeaks would never have happened had the safety and security of the whistleblower not been pre-arranged. The GuptaLeaks investigation alone cost over R 10 million – a very small sum to save South Africa! </p>



<p>Through its work, Daily Maverick is often threatened with legal action – it comes with the territory. They rely on the quality of their work as protection as there is almost no budget for adequate legal cover (although they do benefit from some ‘pro Deo’ legal work).</p>




<p>Daily Maverick’s investigative unit is housed in a separate not-for-profit vehicle which has Public Benefit Organisation status (PBO) from SARS. It employs a team of dedicated investigative journalists and interns who are part of a training program. They collaborate with other investigative outlets like amaBunghane and syndicates through to further media platforms like EWN, News24, eNCA and others when applicable. </p>

<p>On 30<sup>th</sup> October 2009, Daily Maverick launched. Since then they have had some significant milestones as an online news publisher, many of which occurred in 2018. They surpassed 100,000 subscribers to their First Thing newsletter; their Editor-in-Chief, Branko Brkic was awarded the prestigious Nat Nakasa journalism award and the Daily Maverick team, along with their colleagues at amaBhungane and News24, were awarded the Taco Kuiper award, and many others..</p>



<p>The power of the Internet and global social connection was supposed to be used for good and the benefit of the human kind. We somehow forgot that the same power could be developed into a terrifying force, weaponised to ruin things we hold dear.</p>

<p>Truth itself is now under attack from all sides. Truth is not truth. Red is Blue. Up is Down. Good is Bad. Less is More. And facts can be alternative.</p>

<p>Poorly paid &amp; barely protected, journalists are sometimes the last line in the defence of democracy, fairness, or future. We live in a time where Presidents are literally calling journalists an enemy of the people and harassment of journalists is all too common. Journalists all over the world are under attack, both verbally and physically.</p>

<p>Big business shied away from supporting Daily Maverick because we were “too political”. Their response: Imagine if we weren’t.</p>

<p>Scorpio’s work continues to be the most sensitive and, in many ways, the most significant with reverberations so far reaching that not even we can know for certain where they will finally settle.</p>



<p><b>Whistleblowers and Back-a-buddy</b></p>

<p>The catalyst for #GuptaLeaks was the brave actions of two people who supplied Scorpio with the hard drive containing 200,000 e-mails by the Gupta lieutenant, Ashu Chowla. As part of the entire massive #GuptaLeaks project, Scorpio had a moral and professional duty to first ensure the safety of the whistleblowers. The whistleblowers were relocated out of South Africa and Scorpio has now started a fundraising initiative with Back-a-buddy to continue covering their ongoing costs. We salute the #GuptaLeaks whistleblowers - without them, South Africa of today would have been a desperate place. </p>



<p>Connecting the dots between the beginning of an investigation and the impact the story has had on a national, community or personal level is sometimes difficult to do. Often they are asked after a story breaks, “why has nothing happened so far?”. It must be stressed that their job is to uncover the truth and relay it to the public. From there, it’s the duty of those in power to act on what has been revealed. </p>



<p>In 2018, their stories had a great impact on our society. </p>



<ul>
<li>Their investigative unit, <a href="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/section/scorpio/">Scorpio</a>, made massive inroads into the catacombs of State Capture. In the process, Tom Moyane and Jonas Makwakwa, SARS' No 1 and 2, lost their jobs.</li>
<li>The global firms, like <a href="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2018-05-15-hogan-lovells-went-out-of-their-way-not-to-investigate-sars-jonas-makwakwa-documents-show/">Hogan Lovells</a>, <a href="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2018-01-12-sars-wars-kpmg-rogue-unit-independent-inquiry-grinds-to-a-halt/">KPMG</a>, <a href="http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2018-10-05-the-bain-files-part-1-massone-knew-in-advance-moyane-would-become-sars-head-and-bain-would-get-restructuring-contract/">Bain &amp; Co</a>, <a href="http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2018-09-25-sars-gartner-global-advisory-giants-mysterious-deal-with-moyanes-friend-follows-a-pattern-of-tender-corruption/">Gartner</a>, <a href="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2018-06-05-why-mckinseys-eskom-r1-billion-is-still-not-in-state-coffers/">McKinsey</a> were exposed as State Capture's willing executioners.</li>
<li>The massive corruption <a href="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2018-09-05-ipid-vs-saps-procurement-mafia-continued/">within SITA and SAPS</a> was unearthed. As a result, the entire evidence management system was held hostage for few days, but all ended well.</li>
<li>Many a <a href="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2018-06-21-gupta-lawyer-blamed-his-cash-crunch-on-notorious-family/">law firm representing the Guptas</a>, it turned out, was more than happy to help beyond what the law firms should be allowed to do.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2018-02-01-stealing-the-crust-how-the-baktatla-ba-kgafela-were-robbed-of-their-inheritance/">Stealing the Crust series</a>, they exposed how corrupt community leaders teamed up with big business to keep the communities living on the richest platinum deposits on earth, poor and sometimes desperate.</li>
<li>The former Free State premier and the current ANC Secretary-General, Ace Magashule, was exposed as involved in <a href="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2018-10-22-the-great-art-heist-anc-secretary-general-ace-magashule-in-stolen-pierneef-painting-debacle/">stealing a valuable painting</a> from the Free State government.</li>
<li>They started presenting in-depth profiles of the <a href="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2018-11-16-matshela-koko-was-chief-gupta-enabler-at-eskom-alleges-treasury-report/">Gupta's closest enablers</a>, a process which will last for many years to come.</li>
<li>The Secretary of the Parliament's extravagant spending and obsession with armed security was exposed (he is now suspended)</li>
<li>ACSA's long term irregular spending was probed.</li>
<li>And finally, in the wake of the VBS report, they uncovered the many links between the failed <a href="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2018-11-21-vbs-bank-heist-effs-family-ties-and-moneyed-connections/">Limpopo bank and the EFF leadership</a>, which enriched the party whose main plank is the fight against corruption – as long as it involves someone else, it turns. This particular series of exposes earned the reporter, Pauli van Wyk, many death threats.</li>
<li>Rebecca Davis and Haji Mohammad Daji’s story, <href="#.XDdBgGQza1t"><i>Lut’s People: The Struggle to be Gay and Muslim in South Africa</i></a> had an enormous impact on a community level. It was named as one of the International Women’s Media Foundation’s top 18 stories from 2018 (#18in18). More significantly, however, they were informed by two Muslim clerics that the feature had prompted both debate and soul-searching within their respective mosques. </li>
</ul>



<p>Daily Maverick’s Internship Programme</p>

<p>At a time when newsrooms around the country are cutting back, Daily Maverick is committing to the development of young journalists. In 2018, their managing editors Janet Heard and Jillian Green launched the Daily Maverick Internship Programme. They welcomed 6 interns in total - 3 in Cape Town and 3 in Johannesburg. With a retention strategy as a major goal of the programme, we were delighted to offer full time employment to 2 talented interns. </p>
