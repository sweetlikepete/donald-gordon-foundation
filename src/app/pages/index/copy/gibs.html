<p>The Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS) </p>

<p>Founded in 2000, the University of Pretoria's Gordon Institute of Business Science (GIBS) is an internationally accredited business school, based in Johannesburg, South Africa's economic hub. </p>

<p>GIBS is named in recognition of Sir Donald Gordon, founder and former chairman of Liberty Life. This was in acknowledgement of not only his contribution to South African business but also his significant endowment to GIBS. This is just one example of Sir Donald Gordon’s foresight in building a better South Africa with strong institutions, his generosity having stretched well beyond educational institutions.</p>

<p>From inception GIBS has worked hard to be close to business, to understand the drivers of social change and to work with organisations and individuals to explore ways to responsibly improve their competitive performance. The Business School operates primarily in the South African environment and increasingly in the broader African environment, through the provision of high quality business and management education. </p>

<p>Over any given year GIBS works with more than 6 000 executives, managers and scholars from a range of countries, including Europe, Asia and Latin America, and many from Africa. </p>

<p>GIBS has been consistently ranked as the top African business school for executive education by UK <i>Financial Times</i> in their annual Executive Education ratings and is also the only African business school to have an MBA ranked by this prestigious publication.</p>

<p>GIBS is accredited by the Association of MBAs (AMBA), the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), the Council on Higher Education (CHE) and is a member of the South African Business Schools Association (SABSA), and the Association of African Business Schools (AABS).</p>

<p>GIBS prepares students to become successful business leaders. The School’s MBA graduates are making a commendable impact on South Africa, for example;</p>

<ul>
<li>Dr Nthabiseng Legoete established Quali Health, a private healthcare organisation which provides much needed quality medical care to under serviced areas such as Diepsloot, Alexandra, Braamfischerville and Tembisa. </li>
<li>Stacey Brewer &amp; Ryan Harrison who started Spark Schools, a network of affordable private primary schools dedicated to delivering accessible, internationally benchmarked, high quality education in 2013. This school network has grown exponentially since inception.</li>
</ul>



<p>While the MBA remains a cornerstone of the programmes offered at GIBS, the School remains mindful of the unequal society in which we live. Creating managers who have the ability to understand the dynamics of Africa’s two-tier economy is of paramount importance. </p>

<p>In addition to the School’s primary focus areas of post-graduate, post-experience degree programs and executive education, GIBS has also built various specific centres of excellence such as: </p>

<p><b>The Centre for African Management and Markets (CAMM)</b> is a keystone in GIBS’ mission to be “close to business” not just in South Africa, but across our continent. The CAMM team is dedicated to generating and sharing a sophisticated understanding of business in markets throughout Africa, while growing partnerships with business, the public sector and academia to drive better business on the continent. </p>

<p><b>The Entrepreneurship Development Academy (EDA)</b> is the heart of entrepreneurial development and thinking at GIBS. The centre works with entrepreneurs in both the formal and informal sectors, at various phases of their business development, from start-up through to high-impact growth. It has particular expertise in women, township, social and green entrepreneurship, with the development of young entrepreneurs as a foundational theme across our portfolio. </p>

<p><b>The Centre for Leadership, Ethics and Dialogue (C-LED)</b> encompasses activities, programmes and strategic engagements aimed at enhancing interaction between business, government, unions and civil society in the current South African context. The centre brings together a broad range of individuals and groups in order to explore opportunities to better address the most urgent and complex political, social and economic issues facing the nation. </p>

<p><b>The Ethics and Governance Think Tank </b>forms part of C-LED and was launched to confront the risk of South Africa’s future being threatened by ethical failure and grave social challenges. Its purpose is to facilitate a national conversation about business ethics leading to practical measures and outcomes. This will make an important contribution to the understanding, awareness and practice of business ethics in South Africa, and ultimately the moral regeneration of the country. </p>

<p>The School continues to grow and develop well rounded leaders who will take South Africa into the future. The generosity of Sir Donald Gordon has made all of this possible. </p>
