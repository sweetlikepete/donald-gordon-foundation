<p>CDE is South Africa’s leading development think tank.</p>



<p>Since its establishment in 1995, CDE has been consulting widely, gathering evidence and generating innovative policy recommendations on issues critical to economic growth and democratic consolidation. By examining South African and international experience, CDE formulates practical policy proposals outlining ways in which South Africa can tackle major social and economic challenges. CDE has a special focus on the role of business and markets in development.</p>

<p>CDE disseminates its research and proposals to a national audience of policy-makers, opinion formers and the wider public through printed and digital publications, which receive wide media coverage. Their track record of successful engagement enables CDE to bring together experts and stakeholders to debate the policy implications of research findings.</p>



<p>The CDE continues to make the case for policy reform which will give real effect to the South African government’s stated intention to put jobs and growth at the heart of the country’s development strategy. </p>



<p>The past year has seen many achievements where CDE’s impact and its expanding reach into circles of power can be seen: </p>



<p>CDE partnered with Business Leadership South Africa, the most influential business organisation in the country, to develop a major policy document as a resource for business leaders Reclaiming South Africa’s Future: An emergency recovery plan. This sets out the most critical steps that the country needs to take in order to avoid further economic and political decline. The report was finalised by the end of February, although political and economic developments in the country necessitated an explanatory memorandum as a ‘post script’ which was prepared during March. The report has not been publicly released (for strategic reasons as its finalisation coincided with the election of the country’s new president) but it has served to inform BLSA’s strategic engagement with the president and government at various levels from its first draft, as well as the engagements and inputs made by business leaders in the public square. </p>



<p>This partnership added considerable weight to CDE’s recommendations and gave CDE direct access to business leadership. It also offered an opportunity for the new leadership and management at BLSA to get to know CDE and what we can offer. This has laid the foundation for identifying opportunities to work together in the months ahead. </p>



<p>CDE arranged a number of discussions and workshops in preparation for the policy report. The executive director hosted five dinners with business leaders, as well as two workshops on fiscal crisis and state capture with experts in these areas. These discussions assisted with the rigorous analysis that underpinned the recommendations, and ensured that new perspectives informed the recommendations themselves. </p>



<p>Urban-led economic growth </p>



<p>CDE arranged for the world’s leading urban economist, Professor Edward Glaeser from Harvard University to participate in a workshop with the executive mayor of Johannesburg and his senior team, as well as business leaders and urban experts. The focus of the workshop on 24 August 2018 was on how Johannesburg can become an engine for economic growth and prosperity, in line with the vision for urban-led economic growth for the country as a whole. The workshop was followed by a dinner where the executive mayor engaged with business leaders. CDE and the City of Cape Town hosted similar discussions looking at Cape Town with a different focus a few days later. </p>



<p>CDE is now in the process of taking this work forward with the release of a report before the end of the year and further research which will be commissioned in the coming months. Professor Glaeser’s contribution and role was exceptional and CDE is working towards bringing him back to South Africa in the new year. </p>



<p>CDE released an op-ed on this topic last September: Deep change is needed to bring SA’s young people into the economy, Business Day, 8 September 2017. </p>



<p>Labour intensive growth </p>



<p>A major focus of CDE’s work is on how to achieve economic growth that will tackle the huge challenge of unemployment in the country. With this in mind, CDE hosted an insightful Roundtable, Increasing the Labour Intensity of South Africa’s economy on 13 June 2018. It was attended by the country’s leading experts in public, private and academic sectors and the excellent presentations by a range of stakeholders informed a rich discussion and some interesting recommendations. A report on the Roundtable will be published within the next month. </p>



<p>Jobs Summit</p>



<p>CDE set up a series of preparatory discussions shortly after the President’s announcement in the State of the National Address of his intention to host a Jobs Summit. Three dinners were hosted with the CEOs and chairmen of leading companies to think about possible approaches in light of the scale of the challenge that confronts policy makers and leaders. Another two discussions took place which focused on the role of cities in job-creation. </p>



<p>This enabled CDE to develop a clear set of messages in the week leading up to the Jobs Summit which took place in Johannesburg on 4 and 5 October 2018. An infographic clearly set out the scale of the challenge, and the accompanying communication reiterated the urgent need for the Summit to boldly tackle the policies that are inhibiting labour intensive growth and the proliferation of firms that could employ more people. </p>



<p>The op-eds published on this topic were: </p>

<ul>
<li>Jobs crisis needs new approach, Sunday Times, 30 September 2018 </li>
<li>Jobs plan should make large cities opportunity centres for more people, Business Day, 1 September 2017</li>
</ul>



<p>The following areas of CDE’s work are aligned with our strategy of achieving labour intensive growth in South Africa. </p>



<p>Youth unemployment </p>



<p>The extraordinarily high numbers of unemployed youth in South Africa present a particular and urgent challenge. Building on the August 2017 release of research and consultation on this topic over two years and in the 20 metropolitans areas with the highest numbers of unemployed youth, CDE has continued to highlight the plight of young South Africans and their difficulties with entering the labour market. </p>



<p>In addition to presentations on this topic to influential audiences and organisations, three op-eds were published during the reporting period: </p>

<ul>
<li>Deep change is needed to bring SA’s young people into the economy, Business Day, 08 September 2017</li>
<li>How to fix the crisis of youth unemployment in the country, The Sowetan, 12 September 2017</li>
<li>Smart growth and jobs for the army of unemployed youth must be 2019 priorities, Sunday Times, 17 October 2017 </li>
</ul>

<p>CDE is currently thinking about a programme which will help to make youth unemployment one of the pressing topics of public engagement in the period leading up to the 2019 elections. </p>



<p>Manufacturing and employment </p>



<p>CDE hosted a visit to South Africa by Harvard Professor Robert Lawrence, leading authority on manufacturing and trade. Professor Lawrence was the guest speaker at a number of CDE events, including a colloquium co-hosted by National Treasury at which the deputy director general, Ismail Momoniat, warmly welcomed CDE’s work to an audience of around 80 senior officials. In addition, he spoke at two public events, one in Cape Town in partnership with Wesgro, on 27 February and one in Johannesburg at CDE’s offices on 12 March 2018. Around 150 government and business decision makers attended these events. </p>



<p>Professor Lawrence was the guest speaker at CDE’s Global Advisory Dinner which brings together the CEO’s of leading companies, with CDE’s supporters and friends. There was considerable discussion around issues of beneficiation where Professor Lawrence’s expertise and global experience added a richness to the concerns of South African business leaders. A report, The Future of Manufacturing Employment covering these engagements was distributed in August 2018. </p>



<p>Business and reform </p>



<p>Underpinning much of this work has been an additional focus on business and its role in South Africa’s much needed economic and political reform. The chief executives and chairmen of at least 15 of South Africa’s large companies gave their time to CDE for one on one discussions with CDE’s executive director in interviews earlier this year about the role that business could and should be playing in South Africa. In addition, CDE hosted two discussions on business and the new political environment. This informed a presentation by the executive director at the Global Advisory Council meeting which took place on 8 March 2018. </p>



<p>Following these discussions and considerable work by CDE we decided to write a hard hitting op ed about the ‘silence’ in the public arena since President Ramaphosa’s election as president. Essentially we called on business organisations and individuals to lead! See : Business’ path of least resistance to government is a recipe for disaster, Business Day, 21 September 2018. </p>

<p>CDE is currently considering different ways to think through the business contribution to reform both before and after the general election in 2019. </p>



<p>Land Reform </p>



<p>An important topic of vital national interest and attention during the reporting period was land reform. The February 2018 resolution passed by Parliament instructing a review of Section 25 of the constitution made this a national focus of intention. CDE initiated a process of making a constructive contribution to the current debates, and sharing the extensive work it had undertaken on the topic in the past. </p>



<p>During May, CDE released two short notes on the topic: CDE, Business and Land Reform, as well as The Looming Land Restitution Crisis. The former details the work undertaken by CDE in partnership with business ten years ago, as the recommendations are still relevant today. The latter provides on overview of the sorry state of the land restitution process, setting out the facts to inform public debate in the topic. </p>



<p>On 20 June 2018 CDE hosted an expert Roundtable Agriculture, Land Reform and Jobs: Can South Africa make this work? It was a very successful event with participation by commercial agricultural interests and organisations, academic experts and leading advisors to the ANC on land reform policy. A substantial report for public dissemination is currently being finalised, and CDE intends to publish another report on the topic as well examining some of the not very realistic ideas currently popular on small-scale farming. Two op-eds appeared in Business Day and online on these two topics.</p>



<ul>
<li>Land-reform plan has been drawn up – it just needs willing leaders, Business Day, 24 April 2018 </li>
<li><a href="http://www.cde.org.za/op-edhuge-number-of-land-claims-and-chaos-of-overlaps-must-be-resolved-business-day/">Huge number of land claims and chaos of overlaps must be resolved</a>. Business Day on 15 June 2018</li>
</ul>

<p>A report on the Roundtable and related reports and material will be released by CDE before the end of October 2018. </p>



<p>Skills development and youth employment</p>



<p>The number of young people in South Africa (aged between 15 and 34) who are not in education, training or employment (“the NEETs”) now stands at close to 8 million. This is considerably more than the 6,1 million young people who do have jobs. </p>



<p>CDE has started a three-year research and advocacy project, funded by Standard Bank’s Tutuwa Foundation, which will seek to contribute a better and more nuanced understanding of who these NEETs are, where they are located, do they have matric or not and so on, including the particular challenges they face and the support and interventions which could change their trajectory. The research will also look at the training opportunities available to the NEETS, particularly those who do not have a matric. The objective is to develop a set of recommendations for the country on how to tackle this challenge. </p>



<p>CDE will host a workshop towards the end of November which will bring together the many individuals and organisations working in this field, with the intention of establishing a reliable picture of what is happening within this ‘sector’. Two research papers have also been commissioned. </p>



<p>Publications and reports </p>



<p>CDE released four policy reports during the reporting period which were distributed to a database of over 15 000 people: </p>

<ul>

</ul>



<p>In addition to the policy reports, CDE initiated the VIEWPOINTS series and re-released past op-eds on relevant topics as collections focused on a particular issue. </p>



<p>VIEWPOINTS draws on the expertise of South Africans in a range of organisations to encourage informed debate on issues critical to South Africa’s development. All reports are circulated to the full CDE database, around 15 000 people. </p>
