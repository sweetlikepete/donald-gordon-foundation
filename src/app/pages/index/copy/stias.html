<p>The Stellenbosch Institute for Advanced Study (STIAS) is a pioneering initiative established in 1999 by Stellenbosch University. It operates at the cutting edge of science and fosters links between science and society, doing so by structuring its research programme with a strong focus on interdisciplinarity. It already provides a unique research environment, the first of its kind on the African continent.</p>

<p>STIAS follows the known and tested format of an Institute for Advanced Study, with the iconic Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, Stanford, Berlin (Wissenschaftskolleg), Uppsala (SCAS), and Amsterdam (NIAS) serving as prime role models. In this capacity STIAS puts an emphasis on attracting the foremost global thinkers on a regular basis, thereby providing a key stimulus for shaping the local discourse.</p>

<p>In its choice of research projects, STIAS promotes innovative, fundamental and groundbreaking research not for its own sake, but by maintaining contact with African challenges and the practical needs of a developing continent. Its aim is the generation of cutting edge knowledge that makes a difference in the world we live in. As current and completed projects show, its success has far-reaching consequences for the future of South Africa and the African continent. Apart from a very strong publication record in top research journals, the outcome of several of its longer term projects has been captured in the STIAS series of book publications – <a href="http://stias.ac.za/publications/stias-series-of-book-publications/">stias.ac.za/publications/stias-series-of-book-publications</a>. The topics range over <br />
<b><i>The Humanist Imperative in South Africa; <br />
Theory from the South </i></b>– <b><i>How Euro-America is evolving toward Africa; <br />
Climate Change Remedies – Injunctive Relief and Criminal Law Responses; <br />
Education First! From Martin Luther to Sustainable Development; <br />
The Effects of Race, </i></b>and many more.</p>

<p>Over the past decade STIAS has been able to achieve its goals to</p>

<ul>
<li>Advance the cause of science and scholarship across all disciplines and invest in the intellectual future of the country and the continent;</li>
<li>Focus on Africa;</li>
<li>Provide an independent space where innovative ideas and original thinking can thrive.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the historic Mostertsdrift estate in Stellenbosch the STIAS research programme is supplemented by the programmes of the South African Centre for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (SACEMA) and the National Institute for Theoretical Physics (NITheP), both funded by the NRF and DST. Most recently the last remaining historical building on Mostertsdrif (the stables) has been refurbished to establish and accommodate a Centre for Complex Systems in Transition, with a strong focus on Sustainability and the Green Economy. </p>



<p>STIAS now offers state of the art research and seminar facilities for its own programme of research fellowships. Nobel laureates Sydney Brenner, Gerard ’t Hooft, Harald zur Hausen and Joseph E. Stiglitz are Fellows of STIAS, as are Manuel Castells and Ian Hacking, both recipients of the International Holberg Prize (widely seen as the "Nobel" for social sciences) and Donald Gordon Fellows of STIAS; Stephen Hawking and Nobel laureates David Gross and George Smoot count among visitors participating in workshops and public events. </p>

<p><b>Recent Highlights</b></p>



<p>A recent invitation to join a consortium of ten other independent Institutes for Advanced Study, which includes all those from which STIAS drew its inspiration (as listed earlier – the ‘Some Institutes for Advanced Study’ group) signals a level of international recognition which will certainly strengthen the STIAS programme and enhance its ability to draw international researchers of note.</p>



<p>In 2016 STIAS introduced its <i>Iso Lomso</i> (isiXhosa for “eye of tomorrow”) early career support programme for young researchers from Africa, offering a range of support mechanisms and residency at STIAS (and other Institutes for Advanced Study) over a three year period. This programme is now well established (see <a href="http://stias.ac.za/iso-lomso/">stias.ac.za/iso-lomso</a>) and creates a platform where senior academics from around the globe can interact with thevery best of young African researchers.</p>



<p>A number of new initiatives related to long-term theme projects at STIAS (see <a href="http://stias.ac.za/research/themes/">stias.ac.za/research/themes</a>) have recently been undertaken, including first periods of residency at STIAS of a core group of fellows developing a Health in Transion project: <i>The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) &amp; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Moving Towards Early Implementation in Africa. </i>They conducted two annual workshops with representatives from all the major geographical regions of Africa, including a number of young researchers affiliated to the African Academy of Sciences.</p>



<p>STIAS recenty added <i>University and Society: Disruption, Discourse and New Directions </i>(see <a href="http://stias.ac.za/research/themes/university-and-society/">stias.ac.za/research/themes/university-and-society</a>) to its portfolio of longer term theme projects. </p>



<p>STIAS continues to host long term projects dealing with the foundations of quantum mechanics and recent developments in quantum computation and communication. A highlight in 2018 was an international workshop at STIAS on <i>Cryptography in the quantum age.</i> In residence at STIAS before and during this workshop was Professor Jianwei Pan from the University of Science and Technology of China, widely hailed as the “father of the Chinese programme in quantum communication”. In September 2017 many headlines carried the news that his team used a satellite to beam photons to Beijing and Vienna, generating quantum encryption keys that allowed teams in these two cities to video-chat with complete security; he was also named one of Nature’s 2017<i> “Ten People who made a Difference” </i>(see <i><br />
</i><a href="http://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-017-07763-y/index.html">www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-017-07763-y/index.html</a>). Pan gave a public lecture at STIAS.</p>

<p>Since 2008 the Donald Gordon Foundation has established and supported a number of Donald Gordon Fellowships to attract some of the world’s foremost thinkers to STIAS where they pursue their own work within the local context, are integrated as far as possible into a STIAS research project, and participate in a structured programme of seminars and public lectures. These Donald Gordon Fellowships enable STIAS to maintain and expand its role as an address for leading global thinkers for which STIAS naturally has to compete with precisely those institutions (and leading universities) that have inspired its conception and implementation. STIAS has an edge in terms of novelty, global desire for African success, and local costs; nevertheless it has to compete with offers of northern hemisphere salary equivalents.</p>

<p><br />
Early Donald Gordon Fellows at STIAS include Profs Leonard Susskind, Kip Thorne (Physics Nobel Laureate in 2017), Lynn Margulis, Nancy Fraser, Evelyn Fox-Keller, Carol Gilligan, Manuel Castells, and Michael Ruse, former Chief Justice Sandile Ngcobo, and Athol Fugard and Nobel Laureate JM Coetzee.</p>
