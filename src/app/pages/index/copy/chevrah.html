<p>The Chevrah Kadisha is the oldest Jewish organisation in Johannesburg and the largest Jewish welfare organisation on the African continent.</p>



<p>Established in 1888, during Johannesburg’s pioneer <i>gold rush</i> years, the Chev has been taking care of the welfare and burial needs of the community for 130 years. From inception it provided a paternal, protective and unifying influence and accepted the leadership role in developing the community. </p>



<p>Over the years the Chev has been called upon to broaden the scope of its responsibilities beyond welfare and burial to incorporate caring for people who are aged, disabled, mentally ill, vulnerable and helpless as well as children in need of protection. This means providing food, accommodation, health care, counselling, protected employment and educational support to those who lack means and/or are unable to care for themselves. </p>



<p>As the economic climate becomes more challenging, an increasing number of people are turning to the Chev for financial help for school fees, rent, food and healthcare. Inevitably, financial demands put strain on relationships and this, in turn, manifests in more families turning to the Chev for social services: marriage counselling, parenting skills training, divorce mediation, depression and assistance with drug and alcohol dependency. </p>



<p><b>Mandate</b></p>

<p>They are entrusted by the Jewish community to protect and care for those unable to care for themselves. To this end they commit to providing housing, sustenance and healthcare to people who are old, sick, disabled, mentally ill, poor and helpless. </p>



<p>The vast scope of their services makes it likely that every Jewish family in the city is touched, in some way, by the work of this multi-faceted Organisation. Support is provided daily through their welfare and burial services and almost 900 residents are accommodated in their various facilities – Sandringham Gardens, Our Parents Home, Arcadia, and their Disabilities Division which includes Selwyn Segal and their two residential mental health homes, Sandringham Lodge and Sandringham Square. In all of these facilities residents are provided with all of their needs – physical, medical, social, emotional and spiritual. Specialised care is offered to disabled and dementia patients as well as those with mental illness. </p>



<p>Care of the aged population comprises, by far, the largest allocation of funds, amounting to 50% of the Chev’s annual budget of R300m. On the welfare side between 2,500 and 3,000 families and individuals are currently assisted every month with food, rent, healthcare and medication. Their Protected Employment programmes offer work to over 250 people. We provide subsidies to Jewish school children and student loans for tertiary education. In 2018 we have seen an increase of 26% in educational assistance and this figure is expected to continue to rise. As indicated above, their counselling services offer emotional support in all kinds of situations from divorce and substance abuse to depression and statutory interventions. </p>



<p>At <b>Arcadia</b> all the children are Children’s Court placements and housed with them to protect them from neglect and abuse. The residential section is currently full and a large and growing number of children identified as being “at risk” attend Arcadia’s Day Care programme through which they are supervised and monitored in an effort to ensure that the family unit can remain intact. Simultaneously parents are taught parenting skills to ensure that the children are safe from neglect and/or abuse. Healthcare and lifesaving emergency surgical procedures are funded for those without medical aid or resources. Their24-hour Emergency Services provide trauma response, counselling and cemetery services around the clock. The Chev conducts between 500 – 600 funerals each year. Those who can pay for the service are expected to, while people who are destitute and without family are provided with the identical service as everyone else at the Chev’s expense. </p>



<p>The Chev has recently introduced a Holocaust Survivors In-Home Service programme. There are not many Nazi victims remaining in Johannesburg but those who are here (about 30 people) are aged and in need of both physical and emotional support. The Chev provides drivers to transport them to appointments they need to attend; assists them financially and encourages socialisation to reduce their isolation. We are available to improve their quality of life and, in any way that we can, to ease any suffering they may experience.</p>



<p>Mental illness is a growing concern in the community, greatly exacerbated by the severe lack of State psychiatric facilities. The Chev already houses almost 100 mentally ill people in facilities on campus but the number of people needing care is growing and we are not equipped to deal with patients in need of hospitalisation. While the State hospitals turn them away for lack of beds, their professional staff are seeking creative solutions to address this crisis. At Selwyn Segal a secure isolation ward has been established to temporarily contain and calm patients who are disruptive to other residents and who can place their own safety, and that of others, at risk. </p>

<p><b>Thousands of people are assisted, supported, comforted and accommodated every day by the Chevrah Kadisha. In each situation the Chev’s purpose is to improve the quality of life for those who have nowhere else to turn and no one else to turn to</b>. </p>



<p><b>Structure &amp; Budget</b></p>

<p>The Chev runs at an annual budget in excess of R300m and is dependent upon the generosity of donors both locally and internationally to collect R180m through fundraising. It incorporates four major organisations and provides services under nine banners: </p>
